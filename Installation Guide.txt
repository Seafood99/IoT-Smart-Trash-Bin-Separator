**Installation Guide:**

1. Extract the Arduino file only; leave the other files in zip format.

2. Install the Arduino IDE application. If you receive a notification to update the Arduino IDE, go ahead and update it.

3. After the installation is complete, copy the following link: 
`http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`.

4. Open the Arduino IDE, then go to File -> Preferences -> Additional Boards Manager URLs, and paste the copied link.

5. Open the Library Manager. The Library Manager icon looks like a stack of books.

6. Search for the library by typing "Servo". You will find the "Servo" library by Michael Margolis. Then, install that library.

7. Go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library. Add the "LiquidCrystalI2C" and "CapacitiveSensor" zip files.

8. All done!
